1.) For the deque, list, and forward_list types we used the push_front() function, but for the vector we use
the push_back() function in order to fill them similarly. The output is below

The elements in myVector: 2 1 0
The elements in myForList: 2 1 0
The elements in myList: 2 1 0
The elements in myDeque: 2 1 0

2.1) We believe that out of the 4 data structurs above the two that allow random access are deque and vector. Our hypothesis ended
up being correct. The output is below.

The elements in my sorted vector: 0 1 2
The elements in my sorted deque: 0 1 2

2.2) We believe that out of the 4 data strcutres the two that will work with the reverse function are deque and list. Out hypothesis
ended up being correct. The output is below.

The elements in my sorted deque: 2 1 0
The elements in my sorted list: 0 1 2
