1.) For the deque, list, and forward_list types we used the push_front() function, but for the vector we use
the push_back() function in order to fill them similarly. The output is below

The elements in myVector: 2 1 0
The elements in myForList: 2 1 0
The elements in myList: 2 1 0
The elements in myDeque: 2 1 0

2.) We believe that out of the 4 data structurs above the two that allow random access are deque and vector. Our hypothesis ended
up being correct.
