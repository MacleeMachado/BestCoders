Question 1.) Muzzamil Mahmud, Maclee Machado, Zachary Serotte
Question 2.) 1, 2

Question 4.) We believe that the output will be different than last time and that it will output the memory addresses of the two 
variables rather than the values of the variables. 
Question 5.1.) We believe that the output will be the values swapped rather than the memory addresses. When we ran it, the output

and that the output can't change because the pointer is constant and we cant change what it points to.
Question 5.2.)
