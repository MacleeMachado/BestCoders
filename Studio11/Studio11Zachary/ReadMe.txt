1.) Zachary Serotte, Muzamill Mahmod, Maclee Machado
2.) 
	class student {
	public:
		string name;
		unsigned int ID;
	};
3.) I did not use the copy function to do this task, so there was no overload needed
4.) In order to do this we had to overload the < operator.
5.) We needed to overload the >> operator so that the student object knew how to handle the information it was being passed.
