Question 1: Zachary Serotte, Muzammil-E-Haque Mahmud
Question 2: in the console it printed out the name of our executbale file, Studio3Zachary.exe
Question 3: The program printed the name of my executbale file vertically
Question 4: The program continuouslly printed the same memory address
1.) References are the memory address of a value / data type while pointers are the actual value / data type
2.) Pointers can be reassigned while references can't be
3.) A pointer can be assigned NULL whereas a reference cannot
I think that the some combination of the second and third bullet point explain the reason our program did what it did
Question 5.) My program behaved the exact same as it did for question 3

Question 6.) My program kept crashing when it tried to access the second string of the array, so I was not able to determine what
the rest of the strings said, although I assume that they were the other files in the project. The only pointer operator I used
was *, which allowed me to dive a level deeper into the chain (In my case, it let me access the value that the pointer was 
pointing to.)
