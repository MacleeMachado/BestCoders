Question 2: The program expects anywhere from 1 - 100 command line arguments representing their chosen numbers.
The program outputs the winning numbers, and the default value for winning numbers is 10.

Question 3: The program never stopped. It seems as though the program might have got suck in an infinite loop. The
problem ended up being that the program was stuck in an infinite for loop because it was never incrementing the i
value, so I added and i++ line of code and it worked.

Question 4: Now when I run the program it does not print out any output, but I am not sure why. When I debugged
it the program exited and returned code 3. After clicking the  retry button when the program crashed I learned that the
line of code that was messing it up was on line 34, when the program was trying to access the middle index of the
vector that we defined. I noticed that the calculation for getting the middle index was wrong, so I am going to
go ahead and fix the calculation and see if it helps. 

Question 5.) My guess is that somehow the program is not checking whether our numbers match the winning numbers,
and rather just returning jackpot regardless of the comparison. When I debugged it using the Watch attribute
I noticed that in the if statement of line 35 the code used an assingment operator (=) rather than a comparison
operator (==). This fixed the program so that it ran correctly. 

Question 6.) To do this I only needed to make one change and that was to change the WINNINGNUMBERS enum in
the lottery.h file. This shows the usefulness of enums!

CSE 332S - Debugging practice

This program plays a simple lottery game. A user inputs their chosen numbers on the command line (1-MAXNUMBER). The program then:
1. generates a list of winning numbers
2. sorts that list
3. uses binary search on the sorted list to determine how many user chosen numbers match the winning numbers
4. outputs the winning numbers and whether or not the user won(you win if more than half of the numbers you supply via the command line are winning numbers) 

Possible program return values:
Enums for theses can be found in lottery.h
0 - NOTAWINNER
1 - WINNER
2 - JACKPOT 
-1 - INCORRECTUSAGE

Program parameters and their default values:
Enum for these can be found in lottery.h
MAXNUMBER = 100   (numbers generated by the program will range from 1 - MAXNUMBER)
WINNINGNUMBERS = 10 (how many winning numbers will be generated)
USERNUMBERS = 5 (how many user supplied numbers the program expects, as command line arguments)
